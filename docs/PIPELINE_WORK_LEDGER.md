# Pipeline work ledger

**What this is.** One file that every workstream pull request appends to, so
five parallel agent sessions can see what the others did without any of them
talking to each other. Git is the channel; this file is the message.

**Why a file and not a chat thread.** Sessions do not share context. A branch
does. A session that opens this file before it starts learns which contract
lines have moved, which findings are already closed, and which questions are
sitting with the founder — none of which it could learn any other way.

---

## The mechanism, in three parts

**1. The contract.** `tests/test_f1_loop_contract.py` holds the behaviours a
speaker would feel: bookmarks that arrive and stay answered, a document that
is never rebuilt, no number on a user's screen. It runs on every pull request
in this repository, in the unit tier, with no database. The frontend half is
`src/lib/willab/f1LoopContract.test.ts` in `frontend-cursor`.

**2. The scoreboard.** Lines that are false today because the audit found a
real defect ship as `xfail(strict=True)`, tagged with the finding id. Strict
means the suite fails when such a test starts **passing**. So the workstream
that closes a finding is mechanically forced to come here and flip its line,
and cannot quietly close a finding the contract still believes is open.

**3. This ledger.** One entry per merged pull request, appended, never edited.

---

## How to add an entry

Append at the bottom, newest last. Keep it to what another session needs:

```md
### <date> · WS<n> · <branch> · #<pr>

**Closed:** <finding ids>
**Contract lines flipped:** <test name> xfail → passing, or "none"
**Contract lines added:** <test name>, or "none"
**Broke and fixed:** anything in the contract that went red on the way, or "none"
**Open for the founder:** one line, or "none"
```

Three rules, and they are the reason the ledger is worth reading:

- **Never edit an earlier entry.** A wrong entry gets a correcting entry below
  it. The history of what people believed is the useful part.
- **A finding is not closed because a pull request says so.** It is closed when
  its contract line is a plain passing test, or when its own named regression
  test passes and the reviewer agreed. Say which.
- **If you broke a contract line and fixed it, say so.** That is the single
  most valuable line in this file for whoever comes next: it names a coupling
  nobody had written down.

## Current state of the contract

Run it rather than trust this table — it is a convenience, and it goes stale:

```sh
.venv-ci/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_f1_loop_contract.py -q
```

| Contract line | State | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| a Take frozen under the old policy still shows its bookmarks | green | — |
| a Take frozen under its own policy is still filtered to it | green | — |
| every answer decides an item one way or the other | green | — |
| the lock gate asks the page's own question | green | — |
| a Project with no document gets one from its next Take | green | — |
| a Project **with** a document never has it rebuilt | green | — |
| the freshness rule names every route an answer takes | green | — |
| the computation window reaches the writer | green | — |
| the page offers exactly the five owner states | green | — |
| each of the five states routes as itself | **xfail** | F-4 |
| a promoted model cannot reach the document without a gate | **xfail** | LEGACY-1 |
| a later Take proposes and never applies | green | — |
| the words a speaker waits on name work, not judgement | green | — |

Three open, ten held. The three are the audit findings that touch what a
speaker sees; every other finding has its own regression test in its own file
and does not appear here.

## Order of work

Settled with the founder on 2026-09-22. A workstream may run out of order only
if it names why in its pull request.

1. **The live bugs**, because they break what the product just established:
   R-4, G-1, F-4.
2. **The gates that move without a decision**: LEGACY-1 and R-13, then R-1.
   Before any widening to real users.
3. **The write side of the lineage**, every gate still closed: A-1's write
   first and only then the tightening of its serve, then A-2, then B-2 and
   B-3.
4. **The exercise's own foundations**: R-2, G-3 consent, the N1 context. All
   three, or the switch means nothing.
5. **The exercise on**, founder account first.

Independent of all of it, any time: the dataset and release findings (D-1,
D-3, D-6, G-2). Nothing serves from them and no user sees them.

## One warning for every session

The audit is pinned to `backend-cursor` at `87a9309` and `frontend-cursor` at
`6768fbc`. Both have moved. Migration 0351, the Ideal Text recovery rule, the
spinning slot and the two-phase wait bar all landed afterwards. **Rebase onto
current `main` and re-locate every cited line before editing.** A finding
whose line has moved is still a finding; a finding whose line no longer says
what the audit quoted is a finding to re-verify, not to "fix".

`services/ideal_text_changes.py` has changed most. R-4 lives in it, the stored
bookmark set reads through it, and the answered-item marking runs inside it.

## Entries

### 2026-09-22 · WS0 · claude/dazzling-johnson-excc8e · #609, #611, FE #432

The work this contract exists to protect, recorded so a later session can see
what it is holding.

**Closed:** none (pre-audit product work)
**Contract lines flipped:** none
**Contract lines added:** the whole of `tests/test_f1_loop_contract.py`
**Broke and fixed:** none
**Open for the founder:** none

What shipped, in order: the stored bookmark set learned about both answer
routes and about its own clock (#609, migration 0351); a Project whose Take 1
never confirmed an Ideal Text may now get one from a later Take, and the
refusal that left a Take on "processing" for eleven days became a terminal
state (#611); the reserved slot spins, the wait label stopped rewinding, and
the progress bar now spans both phases with its top point reserved for the
document actually arriving (frontend #432).

Two settings the code depends on: `IDEAL_TEXT_FEEDBACK_BAKE_ENABLED` must be
`1` on the backend **and** the worker service, confirmed from each boot log
rather than the panel.

### 2026-09-22 · WS2 · ws2-lineage-or-nothing · #(pending)

**Closed:** R-4, A-2, A-1's write half, B-1, J1-4
**Contract lines flipped:** `test_a_take_frozen_under_the_old_policy_still_shows_its_bookmarks` xfail → passing
**Contract lines added:** none
**Broke and fixed:** nothing in the contract. I broke five unrelated tests in
`tests/test_ideal_text_changes.py` on the way and fixed them — see below, it
is the most useful line here.
**Open for the founder:** A-1's SERVE half. The audit asks for it, your
2026-09-20 decision forbids it, and the order of work sequences it after
this. It is not in this PR. Also one TODO for copy, named below.

Branched from `ec82a73`, not the audit's pin. Contract baseline before
15 passed / 3 xfailed, after 16 passed / 2 xfailed. LEGACY-1's line is still
xfail here because WS1 is a separate branch; when both merge, main gets
17 / 1 and only F-4 is left.

**A-1 IS HALF DONE AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.** The audit's first prescribed
change is "a lineage RPC failure returns `V3Unavailable` instead of serving
without lineage", and it names the test that pins today's behaviour as
wrong. But that behaviour is a founder decision recorded in
`mlc3_first_client_feedback.py:431-460` and dated 2026-09-20: the lineage
was FATAL until then, and one database state (`MLC3_ROLLOUT_NOT_ACTIVE`)
therefore withheld every bookmark from every user on Takes whose frames were
complete. The test the audit wants changed is labelled `# CHANGED CONTRACT
(founder 2026-09-20)` and `# THE LOAD-BEARING HALF OF THE DECISION`.

The auditor saw that rationale — it predates the audit's own pin — and rated
it a blocker anyway; Job 1 re-verified and agreed. So this is a real
disagreement between the audit and a founder decision, not a missed detail,
and only the founder settles it. The order of work already sequences it
("A-1's write first and only then the tightening of its serve"), so this PR
does the write and leaves the serve alone. A-3's
`processing_boundary_not_enforced` refusal is held for the same reason: it
is the same tightening under another name, and inert anyway now that
`PLF1_PROCESSING_AUTHORIZATION_MODE=enforce` is confirmed on every service.

**R-4's named test already existed and proved nothing.** It ran with
`arm_sid` unset, which makes the `elif` false as well, so it only ever
showed that the FIRST branch is skipped and never reached the one that does
the damage. A student GET always sets `arm_sid`. Strengthened onto the live
path rather than duplicated. If you find another test whose name matches a
finding, check what it actually drives before trusting it.

**The coupling worth writing down.** `v3_replaced_changes` is the wrong
question for the superseded branch. It says which policy produced the rows;
what the branch needs is whether the frozen set ADDRESSES them. And a
predicate for "addresses" must use the same identity rule as
`filter_to_selected` — `(id, kind, source, feedback_family)`, all four
non-empty. My first cut compared ids alone, which would have passed rows the
filter then dropped for a differing `kind`: the original defect wearing a new
predicate. `frozen_set_addresses` therefore lives in `take_feedback_set`
beside the filter, not in the caller.

**What I broke and fixed.** A scripted edit rewrote a helper's DEFINITION as
well as its call sites, so `def _r4_v3_row()` became `def _v3_row(S1)` and
shadowed the module's real `_v3_row` for every test in the file. Five
unrelated tests went red; ruff did not flag the redefinition. They pass on
`origin/main`, which is how I found it — when a test you did not touch goes
red, stash and compare before assuming it was already broken.

**Two fences caught me, and both are better for it.** Reading `os.environ`
in `services/gate_flags.py` broke the Q-A5 rule, so the live read is one
narrow `Config.current_env(names)` that takes a list and returns values and
cannot become a general escape hatch. And `log.note` on the predating-freeze
path would have put a marker in the response's `degraded` list, which the
frontend shows — on a response where nothing degraded for the speaker. It
logs instead.

**One TODO for you, in the code at `ideal_text_changes.py`.** A Take whose
freeze predates its rows now SHOWS its bookmarks, but
`record_take_feedback_response_v1` will refuse every answer to them
("feedback item is not in this Take's frozen set"). That is pre-existing and
this change does not widen it, but a speaker tapping a mark that silently
does nothing deserves to be told something. What it says is copy, and copy
needs your sign-off.

**Noticed, not fixed:** `#613` and `#614` merged without ledger entries, so
the contract table above was two lines stale before I touched it (their two
new lines are green and unrecorded). Not mine to write for them, but worth
knowing that this file undercounts.
